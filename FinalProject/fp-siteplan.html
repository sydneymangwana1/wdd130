			<h3>Site Purpose and Goals</h3>
			<p>Have you ever imagined how vulnerable the ordinary non-security technical people are when connected to
				the internet? What about the cost and knowledge required for one to be secure when online? Imagine we
				have a website that rents out such devices and services at a very limited cost! We completely take away
				the management and maintenance of the security device and services from the ordinary users or business
				owners as we place the burden solely upon ourselves for a small monthly cost. Almost all service
				providers in the country sell such devices but with us we rent them out and this will take away the big
				“$” sign from the ordinary people’s mind opening an avenue for them to start seeing the affordability of
				such devices and services.
